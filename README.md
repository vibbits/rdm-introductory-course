#### About this course

This course is composed by **8 sessions** that complement each other aiming to give an overview of the steps of Research Data Management (RDM) based on **practical activities and discussions**. All along we focus in practical and analytical view on the **impact** of this practices **on writing and publishing** the results of researchers in scientific journals. This course contains generalized examples and life sciences dedicated examples, but the content is easily **applicable to any areas of science** and research.
